The IT department wants to create a web-based application to manage IT requirements.

 

·         A requirement can have one parent requirement, and multiple children requirements.

·         A requirement hierarchy may have more than 5 levels in depth.

·         Each requirement has one or more owners.  Each requirement owner has edit access to the requirement itself and all its descendant requirements.

 

Please create an Eclipse project (or other IDEs) that contains the following: 

·         Database tables that can be used to model the requirements, users and accesses.  

·         Necessary Java classes that model the above object and relationships.

·         A Java method that returns all requirements that a user has access to, with optimal performance.

·         Java unit tests for the above method.  


Assumptions:
1. A requirement’s parent requirement cannot be changed.
2. Owners can be added and deleted after the requirement is created.
